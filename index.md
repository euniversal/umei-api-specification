# The UMEI

The EUniversal project developed a universal approach on the use of flexibility by DSO and their interaction with the new flexibility markets, enabled through the development of the UMEI.

The UMEI has materialized in the conceptual architecture design and the implementation of a standard, agnostic, adaptable, and modular combination of different APIs to link DSOs and market parties with flexibility market platforms, in coordination with other flexibility users. This approach allows distributed communication without the need for a central hub.

The UMEI consists of publicly available APIs, allowing any stakeholder to adopt them or to develop new APIs concerning new services while complying with the UMEI interface specification.
